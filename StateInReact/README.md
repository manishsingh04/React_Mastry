# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

State Note:

In React, state refers to a built-in object that stores data or information about the component. Unlike props, which are read-only and passed down from parent to child components, state is local to the component and can be changed (mutated) within the component. When the state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the new state.

State is essential for creating interactive applications in React, as it allows components to keep track of changing data and respond to user input or other events dynamically.
